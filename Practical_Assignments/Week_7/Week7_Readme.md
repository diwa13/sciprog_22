Week 7:

Estimating the value of e:

Compile:

gcc Estimate_Value_e.c -o Estimate_Value_e -lm

Run:

./Estimate_Value_e

Overview:

The value of e is estimated using Dynamic memory allocation.

Function Factorial has been created to calculate the factorial value.

Loop has been created for estimating the value of e.

After computation we are releasing the allocated memory.


Dynamic_memory_Allocation:

To Compile:

gcc Dynamic_memory_Allocation.c -o Dynamic_memory_Allocation -lm

TO run: ./Dynamic_memory_Allocation

Overview:

A function allocatearray() that takes an integer as an argument and returns a pointer to an allocated memory block of that many integers.

A function fillwithones() is created to fill every cell of the array with one.

A function printarray() is created that takes a pointer to an array of integers and prints its elements on screen.

A function is created to free the allocated memory.
