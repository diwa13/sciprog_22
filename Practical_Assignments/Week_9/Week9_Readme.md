Week 9

Compile: 

gcc main.c -o main -lm

Run : 

./main

Overview:

The magic square matrix logic is contained in the magic_square.h file.

The magic_square_input.txt file contains the input matrix.

To read the matrix when the main file is running, use the file name magic_square_input.txt in my case.

The given matrix is read and sent into the magic_square.h to see whether it is a magic square.

The magic square function returns 1 if the matrix is magic or 0 if it is not and prints out whether the square matrix is magic or not.
