WEEK 2 PRACTICAL:

CONVERSION.C:

*Compile the code using gcc Conversion.c -o Conversion -lm

*Run the file using the command ./Conversion

*The code is written to check the number of binary digits using the function log f.


SUM.C:

*compile the code with gcc Sum.c. -o Sum -lm

*Run the file using the command ./Sum

*The difference between two sums  is 0.000007

*Mathematically, they ought to be the same, but the program rounds them off owing to the floats constraint.
