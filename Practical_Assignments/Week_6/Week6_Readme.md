Week 6:

Matrix multiplcation:

Comiple command : gcc -c main.c

gcc -c matmult.c

gcc -o matmultc main.o matmult.o

To run matmultc : ./matmultc

or run using the Makefile

Comiple command for Makefile : make -f Makefile

To run matmultc : ./matmultc

This week, we have computed the matrix multiplication.

Initialization of the A,B and C matrices as well as code for printing the A, B, and C matrices are contained in the main.c file.

The logic for matrix multiplication is contained in the matmult.c file.

We can compile both the main and the matmult files by converting them both to object files and making an executable file.
